# Quantum–Learning Synthesis

Learning systems are bounded by information limits,
just as quantum systems are bounded by measurement limits.

Uncertainty cannot be eliminated — only reduced and bounded.

Deterministic learning systems must therefore:
- Track what is unknown
- Avoid claiming certainty
- Respect information constraints

Learning systems do not fail because they lack data,
but because reality bounds what data can reveal.
