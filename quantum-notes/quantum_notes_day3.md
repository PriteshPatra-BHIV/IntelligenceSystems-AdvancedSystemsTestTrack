# Quantum Study — Day 3

## Information Limits
Quantum systems impose strict limits on how much information
can be extracted from a physical system.

## Holevo Bound
The Holevo bound defines an upper limit on accessible information,
even when repeated measurements are made.

## Key Insight
More measurements do not imply full knowledge.
Information extraction is fundamentally bounded.

## Relevance to Learning Systems
Learning systems face similar limits:
finite observations cannot yield infinite certainty.
