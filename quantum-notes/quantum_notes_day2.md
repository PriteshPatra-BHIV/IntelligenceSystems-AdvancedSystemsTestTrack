# Quantum Notes — Day 2

## Entropy
Entropy measures uncertainty about a system.
Higher entropy means less certainty about outcomes.

## Information Gain
Measurement can reduce entropy by providing information.
However, entropy cannot always be reduced to zero.

## Limits of Certainty
Even with repeated measurements, some uncertainty remains.
This is not due to lack of effort but due to fundamental limits.

## Key Insight
More observations improve confidence,
but perfect certainty is not achievable.
