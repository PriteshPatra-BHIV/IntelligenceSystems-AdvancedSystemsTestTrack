# Quantum Notes — Day 1

## Quantum State
A quantum state represents all that can be known about a system.
It is not the physical object itself, but a mathematical description
of available information.

## Measurement
Measurement does not reveal the full underlying reality.
It produces an outcome based on interaction between observer and system.

The act of measurement updates the observer’s knowledge,
not the past or hidden properties of the system.

## Observer Effect
Observation changes what is known, not necessarily what exists.
Multiple measurements can yield different outcomes
depending on what is measured and how.

## Key Insight
Quantum systems enforce limits on what can be known simultaneously.
Uncertainty is not a flaw — it is a fundamental constraint.
