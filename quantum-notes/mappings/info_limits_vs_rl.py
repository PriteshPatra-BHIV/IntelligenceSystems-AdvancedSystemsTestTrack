Information Limits in Quantum Systems vs Reinforcement Learning

Quantum:
- Holevo bound limits extractable information
- Measurement cannot reveal full system state

Reinforcement Learning:
- Finite experience limits learning
- Partial observability limits certainty

Core Insight:
Decision systems must respect what cannot be known.
Uncertainty can be bounded, but never eliminated.
