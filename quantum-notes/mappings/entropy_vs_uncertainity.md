# Entropy vs Uncertainty in Learning Systems

## Quantum Systems
- Entropy quantifies uncertainty
- Measurement reduces entropy
- Entropy has a lower bound

## Reinforcement Learning Systems
- Uncertainty reflects lack of experience
- Learning reduces uncertainty
- Exploration cost never reaches zero

## Key Mapping
Entropy in quantum systems bounds what can be known.
Uncertainty in learning systems bounds what can be learned.

## Core Insight
Learning systems can reduce uncertainty,
but can never eliminate it entirely.
