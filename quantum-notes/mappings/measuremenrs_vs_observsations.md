# Measurement in Quantum Systems vs Observation in RL

## Quantum Perspective
- System State: True quantum state (not fully observable)
- Measurement: Interaction producing an outcome
- Collapse: Update of observer knowledge
- Observer: Gains limited, bounded information

## Reinforcement Learning Perspective
- Environment State: True environment condition
- Observation Function: Extracts partial state
- State Update: Agent belief update
- Agent: Operates on incomplete information

## Key Mapping
Quantum measurement does not expose the full system state.
Reinforcement learning observation does not expose the full environment.

In both cases:
- Knowledge is bounded
- Uncertainty is unavoidable
- Decisions are made with incomplete information

## Core Insight
Measurement does not reveal truth — it constrains belief.
Observation in learning systems plays the same role.
