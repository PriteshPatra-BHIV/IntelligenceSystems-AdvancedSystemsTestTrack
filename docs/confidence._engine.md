# Confidence Engine

## Purpose
The confidence engine quantifies how strongly a decision
is supported by past evidence.

## What Confidence Means
- Amount of supporting experience
- Stability of observed rewards

## What Confidence Does NOT Mean
- Probability of correctness
- Certainty
- Guarantee of optimal behavior

## Design Principle
Confidence rises with evidence
and falls when uncertainty increases.

Confidence is bounded and conservative by design.
