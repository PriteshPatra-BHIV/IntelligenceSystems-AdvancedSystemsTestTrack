# Uncertainty Model

## Objective
Explicitly track what the system does not know.

## Sources of Uncertainty
- Unseen states
- Partial observability
- Missing feedback

## Key Rule
Unknown information is tracked explicitly,
never inferred or guessed.

## Design Philosophy
Uncertainty is not failure.
Uncertainty is a constraint that must be respected.
