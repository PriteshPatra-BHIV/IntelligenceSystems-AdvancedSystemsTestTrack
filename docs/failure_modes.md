# Failure Modes

## Reward Misalignment
If rewards are misleading or adversarial,
the system will learn sub-optimal policies
while remaining deterministic.

## Partial Observability
When critical state information is hidden,
confidence remains low and uncertainty increases.

## Conflicting Feedback
Contradictory rewards prevent strong conclusions.
The system reflects this through bounded confidence.

## Summary
The system fails safely:
predictably, transparently, and without hidden behavior.
