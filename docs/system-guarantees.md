# System Guarantees

This system provides deterministic intelligence fusion from explicit inputs.

## Guarantees

- Deterministic output for identical inputs
- No dependence on external state or history
- Explicit propagation of uncertainty
- No implicit confidence inflation
- Contradictions are surfaced, not resolved silently

## Non-Guarantees

- No truth arbitration
- No prediction or forecasting
- No authority or decision making
- No inference beyond provided signals

## Safety Posture

The system prefers explicit ignorance over false certainty.
Ambiguity is preserved, not collapsed.
