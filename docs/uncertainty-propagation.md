# Uncertainty Propagation

This system treats uncertainty as first-class.

Uncertainty represents what the system does not know.

## Rules

1. Uncertainty never decreases during fusion.
2. Contradictory signals increase uncertainty.
3. Absence of signals preserves uncertainty.
4. No default certainty is assumed.

## Rationale

Reducing uncertainty without evidence is unsafe.
This system prefers explicit ignorance over false confidence.
