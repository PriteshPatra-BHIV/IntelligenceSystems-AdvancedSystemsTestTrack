# Intelligence Semantics

A signal represents a bounded claim about reality.

A signal is not truth.
It is an input assertion with explicit limits.

## Signal Fields

- signal_type: what kind of claim is being made
- provenance: origin of the claim
- severity: potential impact magnitude (0–10)
- confidence: source-reported confidence
- uncertainty: system-level epistemic uncertainty

Confidence and uncertainty are independent.
Uncertainty must never be implicitly reduced.
