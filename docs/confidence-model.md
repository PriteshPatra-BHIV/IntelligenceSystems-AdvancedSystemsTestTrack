# Confidence Model

Confidence reflects source-reported belief.
It is not system truth.

## Properties

- Confidence may decrease during fusion.
- Confidence never increases during fusion.
- Confidence does not cancel uncertainty.

## Separation Principle

High confidence with high uncertainty is valid.
Low confidence with low uncertainty is valid.

Confidence and uncertainty are independent.
