# Final Risk Report

## Identified Risks

- Low-quality or adversarial input signals propagate uncertainty
- Persistent contradictions reduce usable confidence
- Downstream systems may misinterpret intelligence as decisions

## Mitigations

- Explicit uncertainty propagation prevents false certainty
- Deterministic fusion rules prevent hidden behavior
- Documentation defines strict non-guarantees

## Residual Risk

- System output quality is bounded by input quality
- Ambiguity may remain unresolved by design

## Non-Goals

- Decision making
- Prediction or forecasting
- Truth arbitration

This system prioritizes safety and clarity over completeness.
